Perimetry
=========

A Computerized Perimetry Test for Glaucoma patients to measure the loss of vision. It imitates the real hardware used for these kinds of test. A complete implementation is yet to be done. Please let me know if you have suggestions to improve it.
Please download the read me file to know how to deploy the currebt working code.The followings are the items which I have checked-in.
1. Working code of all the 3 working version, Version3 being the latest.
2. Report which covers the basic background of the science of human vision and how vision can be measured. It also describes the currently implemented algorithm in the version3.
3. Report: steps to deploy the code running on PC and other precondition for the patient.
